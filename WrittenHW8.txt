1. SQL is a standard language used for accessing and manipulating databases.
SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as 
to update data on a database or retrieve data from a database.
It is particularly useful in handling relational databases.

A relational database is a collection of information that 
organizes data in predefined relationships such that data is stored in  
tables of columns and rows. This makes it 
easy to see and understand the data in the database and 
how they relate to each other.


4. PDO (or PHP Data Objects) is a lean, consistent way to access databases. 
It makes it possible for developers to write portable code much easier.  
PDO provides a data-access abstraction layer meaning that 
it allows you to use the same functions to issue queries and fetch data 
regardless of which database you're using.

A Prepared Statement is needed in order to protect against certain hacking 
attacks. Specifically, prepared statements are very useful against SQL 
injections because parameter values don't need to be correctly escaped.
